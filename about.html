            The name, Angel Bunny Apiary, is inspired by my late mom, Carolyn. She had many nicknames for all of her grandkids, but all of them were her "angel bunnies."" Carolyn was the glue that held our family together, she helped us grow, and showed her family was unconditional love meant.

            Carolyn was as sweet as the honey the hardworking bees of Angel Bunny Apiary make. We're small, and like it that way. For all of your local honey needs, just send me an <a href="contact.html">email.</a> We'll be glad to get you some Angel Bunny Honey!
